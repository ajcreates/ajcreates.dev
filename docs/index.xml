      <description>The Puzzle I discovered an extremely interesting probability puzzle a couple days back which is very relevant to the past year. The puzzle is known as the &amp;ldquo;Lumps have hit Flatland&amp;rdquo; and is featured on Brilliant. The contraints are this:
 At any given time, 1/5 of the people in Flatland have the Lumps. When someone has the Lumps, the test always comes back positive. When someone does not have the Lumps, the test comes back positive 25% of the time.</description>

      <description>Day 2: #31Days I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to write #31Days of posts in July. This is my second post on this blog.
School has ended and summer has started!
I am excited to begin many new projects, in both coding and math. I will be beginning a project inspired by FarmBeats that involves:
 using AI and code to help farmers grow better crops. using my own garden outside to test out my code.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m AJ! This is my first blog post to check if my setup is okay. I hope to write about some of my projects and interests.
 Tennis - I am a nationally ranked USTA tennis player and I have played for many years. Books - My favorite genres of books is fantasy and history. History - Reading and analyzing history, especially the history of Egypt and Rome, is one of my favorite things to do and I feel like history is just one big mystery to unravel.</description>
