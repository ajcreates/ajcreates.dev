      <description>On Saturday, I went to Asbury Park, New Jersey, a beach on the Atlantic Ocean. It was a great beach, with clean sand, big waves, and a nice boardwalk. The beach was huge and had a pier and also ships nearby.
History In 1871, James Bradley turned Asbury Park from a seaside community to a residential resort. The park was named for Francis Asbury, an American Bishop. Bradley built the boardwalk, pier, locker rooms, pavilions, and also added electricity.</description>

      <description>I came across a very intriguing paradox in a Martin Gardner book, titled An Unexpected Hanging And Other Mathemaical Diversions. I was very interested in how deeply the paradox divides logic from reality and in how many ways it can be portrayed. It appeared in the 1940&amp;rsquo;s and was discussed by Professor Michael Scriven in 1951.
The Story The story of the paradox goes like this. A prisoner is sentenced by a judge to be hanged on Saturday.</description>

      <description>Today I started my tennis camp which will last for 6 weeks of summer. The weather is very hot and I have a tough team tennis practive lasting from 11am to 4pm. We go through grueling tennis drills, intense fitness workouts, and an extra one-on-one session with a coach. To last these intense sessions, over 3 liters of water is needed.
Morning The morning session of the camp lasts from around 11am to 1pm for me.</description>

      <description>The Puzzle I discovered an extremely interesting probability puzzle a couple days back which is very relevant to the past year. The puzzle is known as the &amp;ldquo;Lumps have hit Flatland&amp;rdquo; and is featured on Brilliant. The contraints are this:
 At any given time, 1/5 of the people in Flatland have the Lumps. When someone has the Lumps, the test always comes back positive. When someone does not have the Lumps, the test comes back positive 25% of the time.</description>

 Tennis - I am a nationally ranked USTA tennis player and I have played for many years. Books - My favorite genres of books is fantasy and history. History - Reading and analyzing history, especially the history of Egypt and Rome, is one of my favorite things to do and I feel like history is just one big mystery to unravel.</description>
