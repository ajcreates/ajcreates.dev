      <description>How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Before you start animating, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to download the Stop Motion or Stop Motion Pro app to create your animation. You&amp;rsquo;ll also need to think of a story to be animated. The story can be about practically anything, from fairy tales to a moment of your life.
The Setup To setup your animation, you will need to make a good studio to work on it.</description>

      <description>Today I started my tennis camp which will last for 6 weeks of summer. The weather is very hot and I have a tough team tennis practive lasting from 11am to 4pm. We go through grueling tennis drills, intense fitness workouts, and an extra one-on-one session with a coach. To last these intense sessions, over 3 liters of water is needed.
Morning The morning session of the camp lasts from around 11am to 1pm for me.</description>

      <description>The Puzzle I discovered an extremely interesting probability puzzle a couple days back which is very relevant to the past year. The puzzle is known as the &amp;ldquo;Lumps have hit Flatland&amp;rdquo; and is featured on Brilliant. The contraints are this:
 At any given time, 1/5 of the people in Flatland have the Lumps. When someone has the Lumps, the test always comes back positive. When someone does not have the Lumps, the test comes back positive 25% of the time.</description>

I am excited to begin many new projects, in both coding and math. I will be beginning a project inspired by FarmBeats that involves:
 using AI and code to help farmers grow better crops. using my own garden outside to test out my code.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m AJ! This is my first blog post to check if my setup is okay. I hope to write about some of my projects and interests.
 Tennis - I am a nationally ranked USTA tennis player and I have played for many years. Books - My favorite genres of books is fantasy and history. History - Reading and analyzing history, especially the history of Egypt and Rome, is one of my favorite things to do and I feel like history is just one big mystery to unravel.</description>
