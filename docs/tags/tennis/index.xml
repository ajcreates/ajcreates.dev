      <description>Today I started my tennis camp which will last for 6 weeks of summer. The weather is very hot and I have a tough team tennis practive lasting from 11am to 4pm. We go through grueling tennis drills, intense fitness workouts, and an extra one-on-one session with a coach. To last these intense sessions, over 3 liters of water is needed.
Morning The morning session of the camp lasts from around 11am to 1pm for me.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m AJ! This is my first blog post to check if my setup is okay. I hope to write about some of my projects and interests.
 Tennis - I am a nationally ranked USTA tennis player and I have played for many years. Books - My favorite genres of books is fantasy and history. History - Reading and analyzing history, especially the history of Egypt and Rome, is one of my favorite things to do and I feel like history is just one big mystery to unravel.</description>
