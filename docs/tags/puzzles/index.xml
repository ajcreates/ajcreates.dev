      <description>The Puzzle I discovered an extremely interesting probability puzzle a couple days back which is very relevant to the past year. The puzzle is known as the &amp;ldquo;Lumps have hit Flatland&amp;rdquo; and is featured on Brilliant. The contraints are this:

History - Reading and analyzing history, especially the history of Egypt and Rome, is one of my favorite things to do and I feel like history is just one big mystery to unravel.</description>
