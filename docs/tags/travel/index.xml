      <description>Irvington-On-Hudson Yesterday, I took a trip to the village of Irvington-on-Hudson, a village in the town of Greenburgh, in Westchester County, New York. It was named for famed American author, Washington Irving. The village is situated on the east bank of the Hudson River, near the Mario M. Cuomo bridge. It is to the north of New York City and has a population of around 6,500 people.
History The area of Irvington was the home of the Wickquasgeck, a native tribe part of the Wappinger people.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m AJ! This is my first blog post to check if my setup is okay. I hope to write about some of my projects and interests.
 Tennis - I am a nationally ranked USTA tennis player and I have played for many years. Books - My favorite genres of books is fantasy and history. History - Reading and analyzing history, especially the history of Egypt and Rome, is one of my favorite things to do and I feel like history is just one big mystery to unravel.</description>
