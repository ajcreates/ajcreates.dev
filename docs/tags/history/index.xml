      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m AJ! This is my first blog post to check if my setup is okay. I hope to write about some of my projects and interests.
 Tennis - I am a nationally ranked USTA tennis player and I have played for many years. Books - My favorite genres of books is fantasy and history. History - Reading and analyzing history, especially the history of Egypt and Rome, is one of my favorite things to do and I feel like history is just one big mystery to unravel.</description>
