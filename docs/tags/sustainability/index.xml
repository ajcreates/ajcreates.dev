      <description>Day 2: #31Days I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to write #31Days of posts in July. This is my second post on this blog.
School has ended and summer has started!
I am excited to begin many new projects, in both coding and math. I will be beginning a project inspired by FarmBeats that involves:
 using AI and code to help farmers grow better crops. using my own garden outside to test out my code.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m AJ! This is my first blog post to check if my setup is okay. I hope to write about some of my projects and interests.
 Tennis - I am a nationally ranked USTA tennis player and I have played for many years. Books - My favorite genres of books is fantasy and history. History - Reading and analyzing history, especially the history of Egypt and Rome, is one of my favorite things to do and I feel like history is just one big mystery to unravel.</description>
