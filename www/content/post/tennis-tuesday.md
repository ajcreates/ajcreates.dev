# Tennis Tuesday

Today I started my tennis camp which will last for 6 weeks of summer. The weather is very hot and I have a tough team tennis practive lasting from 11am to 4pm. We go through grueling tennis drills, intense fitness workouts, and an extra one-on-one session with a coach. To last these intense sessions, over 3 liters of water is needed.

# Morning

The morning session of the camp lasts from around 11am to 1pm for me. In this session, there is a specific parts of tennis the coaches want the players to improve during the day. These can be things like aggressive tennis, consistency, defensive tennis, etc. There are usually a set of around 5 drills that are designed to help improve a part of tennis fundamentals. The drills require mental toughness to persist through since they are not really meant to be fun. The drills occupy the two hours and if their is time, a small game is played.

# Afternoon

The afternoon session starts ater a 10 minute break and goes from 1pm to 4pm. From 1pm to 2pm is fitness. The coach overseeing the fitness training will concentrate the hour on improving a fitness skill necessary to tennis. These include abs training, core exercises, footwork drills, etc. It is a High Intensity Interval Workout (HIIT) and braks are between 30 seconds to a minute. After Fitness is my private lesson. A coach will come and personally train me in whatever needs to be improved. This is from 3pm to 4pm. The training is very tiring but you feel a sense of accomplishment at what you have achieved.
