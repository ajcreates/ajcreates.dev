## Day 2: #31Days 

I'm going to try to write #31Days of posts in July. This is my second post on this blog.


School has ended and summer has started! 

I am excited to begin many new projects, in both coding and math. I will be beginning a project inspired by [FarmBeats](https://education.microsoft.com/en-us/hackingStem/lesson/5d991297) that involves:

1. using [AI](https://www.lobe.ai/) and code to help farmers grow better crops. 
2. using my own garden outside to test out my code.  
3. using a variety of sensors to measure soil quality. I will share the full details soon. Have a good summer! 


## About #JulyOT

I heard about this thing called [JulyOT](https://aka.ms/julyot) which is a month-long event in July where people from all around the world share their IoT(Internet of Things) projects.
