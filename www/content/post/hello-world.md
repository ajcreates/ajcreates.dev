Hi, I'm AJ! This is my first blog post to check if my setup is okay. I hope to write about some of my projects and interests.

 * [Tennis](/tags/tennis/) - I am a nationally ranked USTA tennis player and I have played for many years.
 * [Books](/tags/books/) - My favorite genres of books is fantasy and history.
 * [History](/tags/history/) - Reading and analyzing history, especially the history of Egypt and Rome, is one of my favorite things to do and I feel like history is just one big mystery to unravel.
 * [Sustainability](/tags/sustainability/) - I really want to work towards stopping climate change and pollution and I hope to help find solutions to this global problem.
 * [Travel](/tags/travel/) - I love traveling the world and learning about the history and culture of different places.
 * [Math](/tags/math/) - Math is to me, a big puzzle. Once you have the keys, it is simpler to open the lock. The tough part for me is figuring the right key.
 * [Code](/tags/code/) - I feel coding is a very useful skill to have and I like coding in Python. I use my code skills to try coding robots and making games.
 * [Engineering](/tags/engineering/) - I am a big fan of building challenges and its even better with a team. Even without knowing the rules of engineering, it is a fun to try to build a tower out of spaghetti ad marshmallows.
 * [Puzzles](/tags/puzzles/) - Puzzles are one of the best forms of recreational math to ever be solved. My favorite puzzles are knights and knaves, treasure chests, and "Who won the race?" type logic puzzles. It is thrilling when you finally crack the puzzle and you immediately feel like telling others. You can try some puzzles on [Brilliant](brilliant.org).
