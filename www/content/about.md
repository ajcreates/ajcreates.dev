This blog is to detail all the fun projects I have made so you can try them out yourself. These projects will concern anything interesting I stumble upon, from science to coding. You can try them out yourself, read up on the subject, or try a unique and fun new variation! I hope you learn something interesting from this blog and want to learn more!
